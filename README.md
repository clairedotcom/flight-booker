# Flight Booker

This is a project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack Ruby on Rails curriculum.

To Do:
- deploy to Heroku
- re-seed database with more flight options
- DONE: Keep search form populated with previous search
- Make search form look more balanced. Lots of space on the right side
- Do the search results look ok with multiple results?
- Change date format on New Booking page to MM/DD/YYYY
- Display flight information in larger text, more clearly
- separate lines on Booking successful page, passengers info is on the same line
- send emails from deployed app - how do I do this?
- validate presence of name and email on passenger form
